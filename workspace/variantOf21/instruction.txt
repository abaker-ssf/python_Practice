        There is only one player, and there are two types of scores - the round score 
        and the game score. 
        
        The game score will begin at 100, and the game will last for five rounds.
        
        At the beginning of the round, you will be given two random cards from a deck and they will 
        be added together to make the player's round score. 
        
        From here, you have two options - draw another card to try to get their round score 
        closer to 21, or they can end the round. 
        
        The player can draw as many cards as they want until they end the round or their round score exceeds 21.
        At the end of the round, the difference between 21 and the round score is subtracted from the game score, 
        and then the next round begins. 
        
        After the five rounds, the player is given their total score and their grade ;). Then the game is over!
